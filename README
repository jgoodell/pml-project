The PML file can be used on the command line by

 $ python pml.py pml-example.html

where the result will print to standard out or

 $ python pml.py pml-example.html --file=output.html

where the result will be printed to file.

The file can also be loaded as a python module

>>> from pml import PMLFile
>>> pml_file = PMLFile(open('pml-example.html','r').read())
>>> print(pml_file)
<Rendered File Content Prints Here!>

To follow up on our conversation, we would like to gauge your development abilities when faced with new technologies that you are/are not familiar with (and thus how you would fit into our environment).  Below is the project that we would like you to complete within 4 days.  Please include instructions on how to run your script.  If anything is not clear, describe any assumptions you had to make to complete the project, and your reasoning behind the decision.  Please use Python 2.7 when completing this project.

PML Project
A PML document is a standard HTML document with one additional feature. Any text between the starting <pml> tag and the ending </pml> tag is interpreted as Python source code.
There can be multiple PML blocks in a PML file.
PML blocks will never nest.
The standard HTML should pass through the parser untouched.
The code within the PML tags should be executed with the python interpreter.
A technique should be implemented to write data to the output stream from within the PML. In other words the python code should be able to define the output that will replace the PML.
Variables and functions declared in one PML block should be available in subsequent PML blocks.
PML should be able to handle indentation dependent upon the first non-whitespace line of python code.
 

Example input:
 
<html>
<h1>Hello There</h1>
 
<p>
This is an example of a pml file
</p>
 
<pml>
    def f():
        return "<h2>Good Bye</h2>"
 
    pml = f()
</pml>
 
<html>
 
 
Example output:
 
<html>
<h1>Hello There</h1>
 
<p>
This is an example of a pml file
</p>
 
<h2>Good Bye</h2>
 
<html>
